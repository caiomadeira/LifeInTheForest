# LITF - Improved Kelvin (Beta)



### Part of the **"Life In The Forest"** overhaul series.

**LITF - Improved Kelvin** transforms your favorite companion from a static helper into a dynamic, evolving survivor. This mod overhauls Kelvin's entire progression, introducing a full lifecycle with dynamic aging, RPG-like stat progression, an intelligent visual wardrobe, and enhanced combat capabilities.

This mod is designed to bring more depth to the gameplay, especially focusing on enhancing the **post-game experience**, making Kelvin feel like a true partner in your long-term survival.

##  Current Features

###  Dynamic Aging System
Watch Kelvin grow throughout your playthrough. Time matters, and Kelvin evolves through four distinct stages, impacting his performance and needs:
* **Young** ( rookie, fast, high stamina)
* **Experienced** ( balanced, growing stronger)
* **Veteran** ( peak physical condition, combat-ready)
* **Old** ( fragile, slower, but experienced)

###  Intelligent Wardrobe & Visual Progression
Kelvin no longer wears the same hoodie for years. He now manages his own visual progression:
* **Beard & Hair Growth:** His beard grows dynamically over the years, and he begins to lose hair in later stages.
* **Smart Outfit Changes:** Kelvin utilizes an intelligent weighted probability system to choose his clothes. He will change outfits based on **Day/Night** cycles and **Seasons** (Winter/Summer/Spring/Fall).
    * *Example: He is likely to wear pajamas at night, but much less likely to do so if it's a hot summer night.*
* **Expanded Outfit List:** Includes hoodies, tuxedos, suits, leather jackets, pajamas, and more.

###  RPG Stat Progression
Kelvin's stats are no longer hardcoded. They change and scale based on his current age stage:
* Max Health, Stamina, Heart Rate, Fullness.
* **Fear & Anger:** New dynamic stats that affect his behavior.

### Melee Combat
Kelvin is no longer a helpless pacifist. Depending on his age and config, he gains:
* **Defensive Capabilities:** Kelvin can now block enemy attacks.
* **Offensive Melee:** He will engage enemies using melee kicks when alerted.
* **Cosmetic Armor:** Automatically equips **Golden Armor** or **Military Armor** during combat encounters (visual only).

###  Natural Lifecycle & Mortality
Kelvin is not immortal. He faces a natural end:
* **Grave System:** Upon death, Kelvin's body is hidden, and a grave marker spawns at his location to mark his journey.

###  Full Configuration
You can fully customize your experience. Tweak aging speed, granular settings per stage, combat abilities, and visual toggles.
